# VIBE LANDER

A retro-style Lunar Lander game built by me and Junie using Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform. 

## Introduction
*Hello KMP World.* 

I have been developing software for a loooong time and have always searched for the elusive 
write once, run everywhere solution that works for me. Kotlin is one of my fave languages 
of all time, I really enjoy Coroutines and Flows, and am starting to wade eagerly, but 
cautiously into the rising Compose tide. All the new build tools, plugins, libraries,
and general support has me really excited to see what unfolds in this space.

I also wanted to checkout AI and saw the Junie release and figured why the hell not. 
I got my hands on a new Macbook Pro, dusted off my github account, and fired up 
Android Studio to give Junie a try (that got me close).

I had much better success with IntelliJ IDEA, AI Assistant, and the Junie plugins. 
I started up a new KMP app, and told Junie what I wanted to build (a video game, of course). 
I was kind of amazed when it wrote the first set of guidelines. After a few 
guideline tweaks, I asked Junie to build something. 

It (relatively quickly) built a couple of screens, basic app nav, a rudimentary physics engine,
and some ViewModels. Things kind of worked, but I then stashed the code, tweaked the guidelines 
some more and give it another run (or two). The next day I ran out of cloud credits.
